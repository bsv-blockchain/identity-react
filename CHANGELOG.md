# Changelog

## 2.0.1

- Deduplicate search results by identity key by default in both the search field
  and headless hook. Keep distinct identities that happen to share a name.
- When several certificates resolve to one key, display the certificate whose
  name and field type best match the query. Preserve the first result on ties.
- Keep the existing `deduplicate={false}` search-field option and expose the
  same opt-out to headless hook consumers.

## 2.0.0

- Adopt SDK 3.2.0 identity search recovery; require Node >=22 tooling and React18.
- Enable bounded Contacts fallback for attribute and identity-key searches.
- Show partial-contact warnings, distinguish public errors from empty results,
  and offer retry without changing the query or inventing a discovered identity.
- Scope query caching to each hook/wallet/routing context. Cache only complete
  successful results and refresh contacts for uncached queries and retries.
- Prevent stale results/errors/warnings after input changes, cache hits,
  selection, context changes or unmount; remove abort listeners on completion.
- Use named MUI icon imports so packed ESM browser consumers render correctly.
- Add a packed browser-component render contract, plus real SDK integration, hook race/cache and rendered component regressions;
  remove unused runtime/test-tool dependencies and enforce build/test/format gates.

Migration: install this component with SDK >=3.2.0 and a React18 bundler app using
Node >=22 tooling. Existing component/selection APIs remain; headless callers
can render searchError/contactWarning and use retrySearch. No BRC-100 wire,
wallet permission, signing or storage migration. Deadlines cannot cancel wallet
operations/prompts. Applications using SDK serial-DID token APIs need the
separate SDK3 migration. Prior1.1.14 remains immutable for older SDK2 consumers.
